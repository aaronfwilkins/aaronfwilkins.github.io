Well the portfolio has finally been started and I'm learning how to incorporate blog posts. 
I've started this site based on the guide I found on [this site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css).
I think I'll delete this post once I better understand how to use this.
The site is a Github pages and is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which lets me use
markdown to author my posts. So far it's not that difficult but it is a learning curve and I have to
start thinking about what sort of blog posts I'd like to share on here and how I'll organize
the site itself. There is a lot to do. I guess organization should be step one...
To be continued.

Note: the .md file format which this initial blog post is is the Markdown syntax which then gets
converted to HTML by Jekyll.
