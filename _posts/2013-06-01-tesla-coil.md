## Introduction 
Well, this is my blog and I'd say I would prefer to do whatever I want with it. This is technically my first post and a trial to see
how I can organize my thoughts and develop a consistent way of organizing things so I'll begin by introducing an engineering project I worked on
in the summer of 2013 (it feels like such a long time ago). 

# Humble Beginnings

The first Tesla Coil (Mk I) I built was with two friends in junior high who were much more experienced engineers than I. I suppose I had the ability to 
conceptualize the problem and understand the physics behind the device. My friend sourced the high voltage transformer, known as a 
Neon Sign Transformer (NST), and much of the other supplies such as copper wire and wood. The design was simple
and used two nails seperated by a distance to form a so-called "spark gap". The primary tank circuit consisted of a capacitor and inductor: the
capacitor was a gallon glass jug filled with a brine solution and covered in aluminum foil. Under high voltage, the aluminum foil would be sucked tightly
against the glass of the jug and emit a faint purple glow and smell strongly of ozone and nitric oxides. The inductor, or primary coil, was made of 
several turns of low gauge copper wire - I can't remember how many turns we tapped but it must have been between 10 and 20. 
The secondary coil was about a 9cm diameter PVC pipe that measured almost a meter in height and had close to 1000 turns of high gauge copper magnet wire. 
We could obtain close to 5 inch streamers (bolts of lightning) from the coil but it produced considerable Radio Frequency (RF) interference - 
the most I have ever encountered in my life, and to this day, this was a considerable life event for me. I still distinctly remember operating the device 
in my friend's basement and the power that would emanate from it would turn on computers, speakers, and devices that had no batteries in them. 
I remember us turning off the device, which was very loud, and hearing noises coming from a closet which hid a discarded electronic version of 
the classic board game Battleship. The game had no batteries in it and was clearly many years old, but the Tesla coil had breathed life into the device 
which blinked and hummed to life in my hands. I was blown away by what we had built and I was completely hooked.
